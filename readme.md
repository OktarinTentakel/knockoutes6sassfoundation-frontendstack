# Example Frontend Stack with Gulp, Knockout, EcmaScript6, Sass and Foundation

A frontend stack for ES6-based knockout with Sass and Foundation, especially for larger,
mostly static projects with more complicated parts.

A main aim of this setup is to provide ES6 as well as the possibility of heavily nested knockout-scopes with
statically rendered templates.
